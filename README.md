### What I learned

Implementation of the hover status for a button as well the cursor style settings. also leaned that you can't (or i was trying in the wrong way) use variables as argument for another variable ü§°.

```css
button:hover {
    background: linear-gradient(var(--L-SLATEBLUE), var(--L-ROYALBLUE));
    cursor:pointer;
}
```
